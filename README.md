# To-do List
This is my implementation of The Odin Project's Todo List project. 

# Motivation
I created this project as part of The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum.

# Tech/framework used 
This project utilized: HTML/CSS | JavaScript | Git | Webpack | Local Storage

# Features
Developed a To-do application for users to create To-do Items and Project Folders.

Implemented a form to allow the user to input information for each To-do item, including a Title, Description, a Due Date, Priority level, and any notes required.

Added a section in the input form to allow the user to reassign a To-do item to a different Project Folder, while also removing the To-do item from the previous Project Folder.
